## User Stories

## Notes

Challenges:
I was able to program everything up to the section "Loading and Saving". The NSUserDefaults, ViewController Life Cycle, and Animating View Properties were quite difficult. With no coding background at all, it was quite hard to implement the code given in the instructions without knowing how or where to implement it. Other than that, it was a very fun and concise intro to iOS programming and I look forward to future assignments.
